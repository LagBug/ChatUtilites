# ChatUtilites
A plugin that allows you to control your Minecraft server's chat. It allows you to create or replace commands, spy on other player's commands, run specific actions when events occur, includes GUIs, and has PlaceholderAPI support.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or above.
- A spigot server
- PlaceholderAPI (not obligatory)

## Installation
In order to intall and get this plugin to work in your server, you'll first have to buy it from https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatutils.49326/. After that is done, simply download it and put it in your plugins folder. Now run your server once and then stop it. Make any neccessary changes in the config or messages file and start your server again. You're now ready to go!
